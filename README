The extracted folder should contain the following (6 files and 1 folder)
	A folder by the name TestCases containing 14 files
	CodeGenerator.py
	Group15_Declaration.pdf
	Group15_Prsentation.pdf
	Group15_Specification.pdf
	input.txt
	Phase1.py
	readMe.txt
	
	Phase1.py contains the lexer, parser and the code for intermediate code generation
	CodeGenerator.py, as the name suggests generates the MIPS code from the intermediate code
	input.txt is the default input file

To run the oberon file use the folowing commands
	cd into the directory containing CodeGenerator.py
	Copy the input file (say fileName.txt) into the same folder as above and type the following command
	python CodeGenerator.py fileName.txt
	
By default, CodeGenerator assumes input.txt as the input file

	On running the above python command, two options occur if the user wishes to print the intermediate code and other debugging information.
	If the user inputs y, they are also printed.
	The Intermediate code can be easily understood by the user, but other debugging information is very hard to make sense of.
	
	A MIPS file "new.asm" will be genertaed in the same folder. This can be run with any MIPS simulator.
	
A few test cases are provided along with the code. Their expected working has been explained in the respective files.
